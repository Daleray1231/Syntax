# Local HTTPS Setup for Development
Introduction
To enhance the security of our local development environment, we are introducing HTTPS. This guide will walk you through the process of generating your own SSL certificates and configuring your environment to use them.

Prerequisites
Basic understanding of command-line operations.
Administrative access to your computer.
Steps
Step 1: Install OpenSSL
OpenSSL is a software library used to create the SSL certificates. Follow these steps to install it:

Download OpenSSL:

Visit the OpenSSL binaries page provided by Shining Light Productions: Win32/Win64 OpenSSL.
Download the appropriate installer for your system (Win32 or Win64, depending on your Windows version).
Choose the "Light" version unless you have specific needs for the full version.
Install OpenSSL:

Run the downloaded installer.
Follow the installation instructions. Install it in the default directory suggested by the installer.
Select the option to "Copy OpenSSL DLLs to the Windows system directory" or similar.
Verify Installation:

After installation, open Command Prompt and type openssl version.
If you see version information, it's installed correctly. If not, proceed to the next section.
Step 2: Manually Add OpenSSL to PATH
If OpenSSL isn't recognized in the Command Prompt, you'll need to add it to your system PATH:

Locate OpenSSL Installation:

It's typically installed in C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64 or C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenSSL-Win32.
Add to System PATH:

Right-click on 'This PC' or 'Computer' on the desktop or File Explorer, then click 'Properties'.
Click 'Advanced system settings'.
In the System Properties window, click on the 'Environment Variables' button.
Under 'System variables', find and select the 'Path' variable, then click 'Edit'.
Click 'New' and add the path to the OpenSSL 'bin' directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin).
Click 'OK' to save and close all dialogs.
Restart Command Prompt and run openssl version to confirm it's now recognized.

Step 3: Generate SSL Certificates
Open Command Prompt and navigate to your project's root directory.
Create a 'certs' Folder in the root directory:
bash
Copy code
mkdir certs
cd certs
Generate Certificates:
csharp
Copy code
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
Fill in the requested information. For 'Common Name', use localhost.
Step 4: Update Your Local Server Configuration
Modify your server.js file to reference these certificates for HTTPS. Your development team lead should provide the specific code changes.
Step 5: Update .gitignore
Ensure the certs folder is listed in your project's .gitignore to prevent these sensitive files from being uploaded to the repository.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, verify each step, especially the OpenSSL installation and PATH configuration. For further assistance, reach out to your team lead or a team member familiar with the process.

Feel free to customize this guide to better fit your team's environment and level of expertise. The goal is to make the setup process as straightforward as possible, ensuring that all team members can configure their local environments without running into major issues.
